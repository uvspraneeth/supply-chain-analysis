Business problem:
----------------
Rapid growth in `port harcourt` market --> fulfilment breakdown --> threatening retention of new 
customers --> leadership want the product-level, supplier-level, and customer level insights.

Objectives of stakeholders:
--------------------------
1.  Product avaialbility bottleneck: Identify which of the 200 products are most frequently out 
of stock or are major contributors to Cancelled orders, especially for shipments to Port 
Harcourt and surrounding areas, despite the high order volume. in simple words, What's 
OUT-OF-STOCK or dive cancellation of orders

2.	Customer Impact: Determine if fulfillment issues (e.g., significant delays where Actual 
Delivery Date far exceeds ExpectedDeliveryDate, or high cancellation rates) are disproportion-
ately affecting customers acquired since March 2024 (RegistrationDate > 2024-03-01), and if 
this correlates with lower initial repeat purchase rates from these new customers

3.	Identify Top Supplier-Related Fulfillment Constraints: For the limited set of 15 suppliers, 
determine which ones are linked to the products experiencing the most severe availability 
gaps or quality issues (inferred from ReturnStatus) that impede smooth order fulfillment to 
the Port Harcourt market.
